- This project encompasses an end-to-end data pipeline, extending from an on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Gen2. It utilizes Azure Data Factory for data ingestion, leverages Databricks for layered data processing, employs Azure Synapse for analytics, and integrates Power BI for reporting. Security is reinforced through Azure Active Directory and Key Vault.
- Detailed documentation is provided in the Notes word files, offering a step-by-step guide on how the project was executed.
- Data from the on-premise SQL Database was transferred to Azure Data Lake Gen 2 using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
- Data transformation was conducted using Databricks.
- The transformed data was then loaded into a cloud database created in Azure Synapse Analytics. This database was connected to Power BI to generate insightful visualizations.
